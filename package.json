  "description": "iHave.to was created to be creative focusing ideas as they come and bring the tools to follow how those ideas were grown. It's also possible to be creative in a collaborative way via realtime multiuser support. Your memo data is strongly protected using AES on your device until any authenticated endpoint. If you're using iHave.to in a collaborative way only the encryptet data difference is broadcasted to any user who's actually on the memo board.",
