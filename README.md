#iHave.to/do#
##AES secured and real time enabled plain memoboard##

iHave.to was created to be creative focusing ideas as they come and bring the tools to follow how those ideas were grown.
It's also possible to be creative in a collaborative way via realtime multiuser support.
Your memo data is strongly protected using AES on your device until any authenticated endpoint.
If you're using iHave.to in a collaborative way only the encryptet data difference is broadcasted to any user who's actually
on the memo board.

**And YES, you can customize your memo board with custom wallpapers ;-)**.
